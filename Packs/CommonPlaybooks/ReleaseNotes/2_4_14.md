##### CVE Enrichment - Generic v2

- Updated the playbook output to include several missing command outputs for **VulnDB** and **IBM X-Force Exchange** integrations.
- Replaced the deprecated **'CVE Search'** integration with the **'CIRCL CVE Search'** integration.
- Replaced the deprecated automation input *'cve_id'* with *'cve'* in the **'Get CVE info from CIRCL CVE Search'** task.
- Integration availability checks for CVE Search and IBM X-Force Exchange have been removed since CVE enrichment in these integrations is performed with generic commands.
